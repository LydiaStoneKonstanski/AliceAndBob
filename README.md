    * Object instantation/declaration
    * Method invokation

### Instructions

3. Print greeting to screen if Alice or Bob are true
4. Print "You are neither Alice nor Bob."
5. When finished, make *certain* your last commit message is "finished"

### Input & Output

Standard input and standard output are important concepts in Java programming.

Standard input is a way for a program to receive input from the user or another program. In Java, standard input is represented by the `System.in` object. This object can be used with a Scanner object to read input from the user or another program. For example, the following code reads a line of text from the user and stores it in a variable:

```java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("Enter your name: ");
String name = scanner.nextLine();
```

Standard output is a way for a program to output information to the user or another program. In Java, standard output is represented by the `System.out` object. This object can be used with the println() method to output text to the console. For example, the following code outputs a greeting to the user:

```java
System.out.println("Hello, " + name + "!");
```

Standard input and standard output are important concepts in Java programming that allow programs to interact with the user and other programs.
